  "subtitle": "In early January 1950, government departments finalized the massive administrative transition and planned the historic ceremonies for the upcoming Republic Day.",
  "summary": "The first two weeks of January 1950 were a period of intense and meticulous preparation across India. With the new Constitution set to come into force on January 26, government departments in New Delhi and the state capitals were busy finalizing the vast administrative and legal changes required. This involved everything from preparing new official stationery to retraining officials on their new constitutional roles. Simultaneously, this period was marked by intense logistical planning for the upcoming **Republic Day** celebrations, a historic event that would replace the King-Emperor with a new, elected President as Head of State.",

  "historicalContext": "India had achieved independence in 1947 but had remained a **Dominion** within the British Commonwealth, meaning King George VI was still the official Head of State, represented by a Governor-General (C. Rajagopalachari). The **Constituent Assembly of India**, a body of elected representatives, had spent the last three years (1946-1949) drafting a new, sovereign constitution. This constitution was formally adopted on **November 26, 1949**. The date of **January 26** was then chosen for its implementation, as it was a symbolic anniversary of the 1930 'Purna Swaraj' (Total Independence) declaration.",
  "prelude": "The adoption of the Constitution on November 26, 1949, was the key prelude. This 'set the clock' for the January 26 transition, giving the government, led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, exactly two months to prepare for the massive legal and ceremonial 'changeover' from a dominion to a republic.",
